# airbox-deepkriging

Here is an example Python program using Google Colab for the article "Some Enhancements to DeepKriging." It implements our modification of DeepKriging and applies the method to the spatial prediction of AirBox PM2.5 data.

The .csv file and map files should be placed in the right path. Specifically, we put files in the following locations. Users can modify the corresponding paths.

 * Colab Notebooks/ contains real_Data_analysis.ipynb and airbox21-01-08.csv.
 * Colab Notebooks/shapefile/ contains TWshapefile.dbf, TWshapefile.dbf, and TWshapefile.shx

The data were derived from the following resources available in the public domain: Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform at https://ci.taiwan.gov.tw/dsp/history/iis_airbox/
